/*
 * Corpus-witnessed (SR number, width) pairs; srops probe session 2026-08-25,
 * one Apple-compiled kernel per MSL builtin, identical numbers on agx3b and
 * agx3c. 16-bit: 6 simdgroup_index_in_threadgroup, 7 thread_index_in_simdgroup,
 * 9/10/11 thread_position_in_threadgroup.xyz, 13 thread_index_in_threadgroup,
 * 17/18/19 threads_per_threadgroup.xyz, 20/21/22
 * dispatch_threads_per_threadgroup.xyz, 34/36 (witnessed in Apple device-atomic
 * kernels, attribution UNKNOWN). 32-bit: 23/24/25 thread_position_in_grid.xyz,
 * 26/27/28 threadgroup_position_in_grid.xyz.
 *
 * Two more 16-bit numbers are fragment-only and were added from the G17P
 * writeout session (offline `applegpu-nt -arch applegpu_g17p`, 2026-08-31):
 *
 *  - 39 is the *incoming* coverage word. PROVEN: a fragment shader that reads
 *    `uint m [[sample_mask]]` compiles to exactly `rld h0 <- SR 39 (W16)`,
 *    `h0 >>= 4`, `int2flt`, so the incoming mask sits in bits 4..7.
 *  - 2 is read by every 1x fragment shader that writes a sample mask or a
 *    depth and by no colour-only shader; its value is combined into the staged
 *    coverage word as N | (T << 4) | (T << 8). Reproducing Apple's own
 *    kill-all constant from that formula requires T = 0xF0, i.e. a four-bit
 *    mask in bits 4..7 exactly like SR 39. Presence and use are PROVEN;
 *    "the per-invocation target-sample mask" is INFERRED from that arithmetic.
