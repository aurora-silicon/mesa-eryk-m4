 * AGX3 ray-traversal instruction core: composer-driven encoders for the five
 * hardware operations Apple's compiler emits for ray tracing, plus the
 * barrier that prefixes the BVH-update expansions.
 *
 *   intersect_ray   12B (AGX3b) / 14B (AGX3c)
 *   continue_ray     6B (AGX3b) /  8B (AGX3c)
 *   incStk           8B on both encodings
 *   barrier          6B on both encodings (the RT-expansion scope form)
 *   update_node      4B (AGX3b) /  8B (AGX3c)
 *   update_bvh       8B, AGX3c witness only -- AGX3b is refused
 *
 * Everything here is encoded through the generic table encoder
 * (agx3_compose, generated from Apple's own llvm::AGX3 encoder tables) from
 * per-form baselines recovered by decoding the witnessed corpus bytes, so a
 * wrong baseline cannot silently produce a valid-looking instruction.  The
 * witnesses are the same ones the byte-level codecs in agx3_pack.c pin:
 *
 *  - intersect_ray / continue_ray: the decoded G16G/G17S corpus vectors in
 *    test/agx3_compose_corpus_vectors.c (intersect cases 263/470/561/651 and
 *    1006/1252/1351/1453; continue cases 275/482/573/663 and
 *    1017/1263/1361/1463) plus the pinned five-kernel RT corpus ladders that
 *    agx3_pack_{intersect,continue}_ray accept.  The test replays every
 *    accepted value byte-for-byte against those codecs' deposit scheme.
 *  - incStk, barrier, update_node, update_bvh: the exact fixed witnesses in
 *    agx3_pack.c (agx3_pack_inc_stk_fixed_witness, agx3_pack_update_node,
 *    agx3_pack_update_bvh_fixed_witness), decoded to composer fields and
 *    re-encoded byte-exactly.
 *
 * Fail-closed boundaries -- what is deliberately NOT encodable here, and
 * which witness is missing:
 *
 *  - update_bvh on AGX3b: Apple's tables spell the form, but no AGX3b
 *    update_bvh instruction exists in any pinned corpus.  Missing witness: a
 *    G15/G16/G17P native binary containing the llvm.agx3.update.bvh
 *    expansion.  Refused.
 *  - Operands on update_node / update_bvh / incStk: the intrinsics take
 *    arguments, but no corpus differential correlates any argument to a
 *    machine field (incStk's sole nonzero Apple-table operand decodes as
 *    f24=4 with no value ladder).  Missing witness: operand-varying
 *    differential pairs.  Only the canonical fixed bytes are encodable.
 *  - intersect_ray / continue_ray fields other than f5: the anonymous
 *    selector/hint fields are held at their corpus values (the alternate
 *    witnessed intersect_ray tuples are reachable only through the
 *    enumerated witnessed-site replay below).  Missing witness: semantic
 *    differentials for those fields.  f5 itself is a 13-bit half-register
 *    field per Apple's tables; its ray-state/SCS role is an inference from
 *    the surrounding lowering.
 *  - Scoreboard/wait variation on any RT form: every witnessed RT
 *    instruction carries the same wait/hint bits, so no wait mask is
 *    exposed.  Missing witness: an RT instruction with a different wait set.
 *  - Scheduling, SCS layout, traversal lowering, the shared-memory and
 *    control-flow instructions between the RT ops, submission, and any API
 *    capability are outside this encoder, exactly as for agx3_pack.c.
