# G17P native RT0 EOT witness

This replaces the earlier compute-wrapper EOT witness for the bounded
single-layer, one-sample RGBA8/BGRA8 RT0 path. The installed Apple GPU compiler's
real builtin EOT factory produces a fragment object with 68 bytes of text.

The adjacent `g17p-native-rt0-eot.btnf.hex` is the complete 123-byte input,
not an edited shader or relabelled compute metadata. Decode it with `xxd -r -p`
and invoke the matching Apple Metal toolchain:

```sh
xxd -r -p g17p-native-rt0-eot.btnf.hex > eot_rt0.btnf
xcrun metal-nt -N eot_rt0.btnf -arch applegpu_g17p \
  -platform_version macos 26.0 26.0 -o eot_rt0.nat
```

Toolchain versions can change object packaging; the pinned executable text is:

The original outer `__TEXT,__builtin` contains the fragment Mach-O at offset
0x4d0. Its metadata has common field0=3 GPR dwords and fields38/42 D=16.
The implementation conservatively allocates eight GPR halves (native needs
six) and eight staging halves; those quantities are independent.

## Input and binding contract

BTNF vendor root field2=5 selects the genuine EOT factory. Root field3 has
EOT configuration union discriminator4, one attachment and enabled mask1.
The attachment fields produce key `0x10020300`: partition0, internal format3,
texture type/layout code2, four components, no extra flags.

The native object's ESL records are `(kind,count32,dest32,source32)`:

- `(3,2,0,0)`: qword binding0x32 supplies the raw, 32-byte-aligned PBE-table
  GPU VA to uniform halves0..3.
- `(0,1,2,0)`: the sole driver argument, kind5/index0/destination0, supplies
  the imageblock byte offset as a 32-bit value to uniform halves4..5.

Its `__GPU_LD_MD` RT store mask (field11) is1. ESL kind3 and driver-argument
kind3 are different namespaces; no inline PBE32 uniform payload is requested.

Matching UMD `AGXMetalG17P.arm64e` SHA-256
`b641761d0ecb74babe7fbce66cb895bc180fe008f4d4c533845138c4eb64217b`:
binding0x32 maps to driver qword0x36 at +0x1b0 (0x392944–0x392970).
Kind5 maps to driver dword0x72 at +0x1c8 (0x392ed8/0x3931b8).
`configurePBE` at 0x331788–0x331798 writes
`((draw_state >> 12) & 255) % sample_stride` to framebuffer+0x388+4*RT.
For the admitted unspilled single RT0, the offset is0 and sample stride8.
Mesa takes this value from `agx_tilebuffer_offset_B`, not BO/image dimensions.

The shader's four SR reads obtain group position and dispatched group size.
Two products generate staging coordinates for the block origin. PACK reads
the byte-offset uniform and IMGW reads the table pointer with RT index0.
The complete 68-byte entry is uploaded directly into the existing CODE
container at block+0x80, padded to128 bytes; LDSHDR f1 remains1.

## Validation scope

On J700 A18 Pro B1, native DM1, the old per-thread-coordinate program stored
only the first 32x32 tile of a 512x512 target. The matched native shader and
CProg pair passed a contained orange triangle over red clear: 73,536 strict
interior, 188,224 strict exterior and 384 edge-centre pixels, zero mismatches,
with the full image byte-identical three seconds after the fence. No shader
diagnostic override was enabled. This proves this bounded spatial path, not
MRT, MSAA, arbitrary formats, repeated submissions or Vulkan conformance.
