"""Static gate tying the advertised feature level to its implementation.

A feature level is a promise about behaviour, and the number is one line of
code.  These assertions keep each of the three requirements 12_0 adds over
11_1 attached to the code that actually satisfies it, so removing the
implementation breaks the build gate rather than the application.
