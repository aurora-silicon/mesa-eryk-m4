# Run every d3d12agx GPU acceptance suite with its correct shader arguments.
#
# The argument lists are the part that is easy to get wrong -- each test takes
# a different set of shaders, and a wrong name makes a test print usage and
# exit 0, which reads as a pass in a loop that only checks the last line.
# Keep this file as the single source of truth. A suite that produces no
# verdict line at all is a FAILURE here, not a silent pass.
