"""Check strict32 clear-only and triangle recordings from the no-op DRM shim.

Usage: test-g17p-clear-only-recording.py CLEAR_LOG TRIANGLE_LOG CONTROL_LOG
The control is the frozen pre-fix triangle+marker recording. This checks
recording, not execution: no-op shim pixels and marker must stay untouched.
